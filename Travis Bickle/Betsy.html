        <p class = "w3-center">Betsy is played by actress Cybill Shepard and has already made her marked in the movie industry with films like The Last Picture Show (1970).<br>
        Betsy is more of a mysterious character as the film doesn't give much information about herself. Despite having a short relationship with Travis, it's<br>
        clearly an importance one for Travis and further emphasis the feeling of cynicism and loneliness. She works as a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palantine<br>
        and typically talks to her co-worker Tom. They both notice Travis as he drives his taxi consistency around the headquarters and makes Betsy a little uncomfortable. However, when Travis does ask her out<br>
        it seems that she kind of has a little bit respect for him being up front about his feeling about her. Howver, after Travis diastously screws up the date for the both of them she firmly made the decision to not <br>
        associate herself to Travis. After the date we rarely see her in film to further emphasize to distance of where her and Travis are at.</p>
