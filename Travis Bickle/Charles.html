        <p class = "w3-center">Charles Palantine is played by Leonard Harris who only has two major film credit, with this movie being to most memorable from his short career.<br>
        In the film Charles is a senator in New York and is making a promising campaign to run of the Oval Office, and has a big fanbase among to citizens in New York City.<br>
        Due to Travis love for Betsy has a endlessly supported Palantine's campaign for president, despite not knowing any of his policies. One night working in the night shift<br>
        Travis pick up Mr.Palantine himself along with his security going to a obligation. The conversation starts with Travis praising Palantine saying "You're great man everybody I know is gonna vote for you"<br>
        ,then leads to Travis venting out his frustrations on the city. Palantine response was a vague but sucessful response to Travis triad where there needed to be radical changes, which<br>
        Travis response "Damn straight". Once dropping off Palantine to his location Travis felt the need to say to Palantine that's he a good man and is sure he would win the race.<br>
        This would be both entire interaction in the film, and it showcases Travis's desperation of fast change within the city of New York and uses Palantine as some sort of demigod<br>
        to represent a better and moral future.</p>
