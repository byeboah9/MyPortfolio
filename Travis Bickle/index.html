                    <p> The character for this Portfolio is Travis Bickle from the movie Taxi
                        Driver(1976), directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. The movie was critically
                        acclaimed with it winning the prestigous Palm d'or
                        and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Pictures and Best Leading Actor performances
                        for Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle is meant to embodied the
                        loniessness of men and combine with the cyanical/ dangerous Outside world
                        can really mess with the human psyche much more easily than one would expect. This film has
                        inspired generations of younger generations and films most particularly Joker(2019).

                        Travis Bickle resides in New York City where he finds employment as a Taxi Driver, to curb his
                        ever
                        growing
                        insomnia. It's stated that in the film
                        he is a Vietnam War veteran and was in the Marine sector. A lot of Travis's condition of mental
                        instablity
                        to subtlely hinted as PSTD, which Travis hasn't recognize as such.
                        In the beginning of the film it's to be said that Travis is single and has very lonely thoughts
                        to stop
                        this, however condicts himself sometimes by being a

                        Travis Bickle is a complex character to analyze, however his intention throughtout the film are
                        clear.
                        He a man who is desperate to find someone to keep him company whether it be a girlfriend,
                        co-worker, or
                        a reliable person he can depend on. In the beginning of the film we know Travis's background and
                        characteristics he still believe in a better future for him and his
                        surrondings. When he first see Betsy for the first time Travis felt a potential of long-lasting
                        love and
                        comfort, especially needed in the harsh streets of NYC.
                        It even translates with his support of presidential candidate Charles Palantine, as Betsy is a
                        campaign
                        worker for him. After a date gone wrong with Betsy and her
                        seeming very uninterested with him, Travis is back to the same state as he was before, but now
                        more
                        angry and sad with his situation. He has no one to help or deeply talk to as
                        his job is there to pay the bills, and his co-workers are more like acquintances. His motivate
                        changes
                        after an incident where a skipliy clad girl comes to after taxi out of nowhere and
                        asked him to hurry and leave. However, she is stopped by a mysterious man where he gives Travis
                        some
                        money to compensate for the distrubance in his car, and
                        takes the girl with him. Feeling a little complicit about doing nothing to help the girl, Travis
                        works
                        while trying to find the girl who was in his car wanting
                        help. Eventually getting finding her location, he discovers that this young girl is a postitute
                        and the
                        man who took out of the car is her pimp. Disgusted with the
                        siutation going on Travis is set on helping this young girl (named Iris)to escape her
                        predictment. The
                        two become somewhat friends and he made an agreement with her to give her
                        money to left her job and move far away from there. Whilst this happens Travis is even more
                        mental
                        destroy with see what unmoralism seeing in front of his eyes, and feels that
                        the people in power are there to blame, so decides to plan to kill Charles Palantine. When he
                        failed to
                        asssassinate him and luckliy escapes, and
                        changes his plan to get Iris out of place by force.

                            Betsy is played by actress Cybill Shepard and has already made her mark in
                            the movie industry with films like The Last Picture Show (1970).
                            Betsy is more of a mysterious character as the film doesn't give much information about
                            herself.
                            Despite having a short relationship with Travis, it's
                            clearly an importance one for Travis and further emphasis the feeling of cynicism and
                            loneliness. She works as a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palantine
                            and typically talks to her co-worker Tom. They both notice Travis as he drives his taxi
                            consistency around the headquarters and makes Betsy a little uncomfortable. However, when
                            Travis
                            does ask her out
                            it seems that she kind of has a little bit respect for him being up front about his feeling
                            about her. Howver, after Travis diastously screws up the date for the both of them she
                            firmly
                            made the decision to not
                            associate herself to Travis. After the date we rarely see her in film to further emphasize
                            to
                            distance of where her and Travis are at.

                    Iris Steensma is played by a Jodie Foster a role which attracted controversy initally due to the
                    part of
                    what her character is, and believing
                    that it was inapporiate for a girl that young to be playing such a role. Nevertheless, Foster
                    received
                    her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress and believes that
                    a role like this help formed her acting skills even more. Iris background is that she ran out from
                    home
                    and move to Manhattan. She was quickly picked up in the dark underbelly of the city
                    get a job as an underage prositiute by a pimp named Sport. Now Sport and her have a relatively
                    friendly
                    and loving relationship (albeit Stockholm Syndrome), and Iris is quick to defend him, as
                    she can't recollected a memory where she was abused by him. Travis first meets Iris when she comes
                    to
                    his taxi wanting to leave, but Sport catches her on time. With this experience affectong him
                    deeply
                    he eventually meet up with her, by posing as a customer with true intention of freeing her. With
                    Travis
                    trying to free Iris along the way they get to know each other a bit, where their conversations
                    exposes
                    Iris
                    naivete by putting her logic with astronomy and not fully grasping the situation at hand. With this
                    both
                    made an agreement that Travis would send her money for
                    her to move to a commune in Vermont. Their relationship is Travis's morality need to take action to
                    put
                    it in his own words "getting rid of dog, the filth". Him getting
                    fed up with such deprave actions within his community.

                    Charles Palantine is played by Leonard Harris who only has two major film credit, with this movie
                    being
                    to most memorable from his short career.
                    In the film Charles is a senator in New York and is making a promising campaign to run of the Oval
                    Office, and has a big fanbase among to citizens in New York City.
                    Due to Travis love for Betsy has a endlessly supported Palantine's campaign for president, despite
                    not
                    knowing any of his policies. One night working in the night shift
                    Travis pick up Mr.Palantine himself along with his security going to a obligation. The conversation
                    starts with Travis praising Palantine saying "You're great man everybody I know is gonna vote for
                    you"
                    ,then leads to Travis venting out his frustrations on the city. Palantine response was a vague but
                    sucessful response to Travis triad where there needed to be radical changes, which
                    Travis response "Damn straight". Once dropping off Palantine to his location Travis felt the need to
                    say
                    to Palantine that's he a good man and is sure he would win the race.
                    This would be both entire interaction in the film, and it showcases Travis's desperation of fast
                    change
                    within the city of New York and uses Palantine as some sort of demigod
                    to represent a better and moral future.
